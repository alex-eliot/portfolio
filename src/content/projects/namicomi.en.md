# Rich. Fast. Comfortable comic reading experience.

The next collaboration is the design and programming of a platform where comic artists upload their comics for fans to read at their leisure. The two can interact with each other through a built-in social platform, and more.

- The programming of the Reader was the most important, where the most attention was paid to make it comfortable for all devices, as well as fast in order to stand out from the competition.
  - Using HTML Canvas techniques and the Swiper library, my partner and I were able to build a Reader that adapts to every possible resolution of the comic's images, as well as the appropriate way in which it is read (left-to-right, right-to-left, etc.).
  - The dozens of settings provided by the Reader allows the reader to customize it to have the most comfortable reading experience on any device.
- It consists of three (3) parts: the main page, the Studio platform for artists to manage their comics and subscriptions, and the Admin platform where access is provided to administrators to oversee the content of the site, provide support services and more.
- It's multilingual using i18n practices, without duplicating content or the need to create multiple clips for each language. This way, translations are streamlined, making maintenance cheaper and faster.
